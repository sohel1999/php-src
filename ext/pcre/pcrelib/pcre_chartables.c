/* This file contains character tables that are used when no external tables
are passed to PCRE by the application that calls it. The tables are used only
for characters whose code values are less than 256.

This is a default version of the tables that assumes ASCII encoding. A program
called dftables (which is distributed with PCRE) can be used to build
alternative versions of this file. This is necessary if you are running in an
EBCDIC environment, or if you want to default to a different encoding, for
example ISO-8859-1. When dftables is run, it creates these tables in the
current locale. If PCRE is configured with --enable-rebuild-chartables, this
happens automatically.

The following #includes are present because without them gcc 4.x may remove the
array definition from the final binary if PCRE is built into a static library
and dead code stripping is activated. This leads to link errors. Pulling in the
header ensures that the array gets flagged as "someone outside this compilation
unit might reference this" and so it will always be supplied to the linker. */
